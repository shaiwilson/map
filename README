Implemented with Java using the google map api. Created my own intersection data pulled from a region in San Diego. 
Using my own data structures and depth first search, breadth first search, and Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.

---------------------------------------------------------[ DESCRIPTION ]--
DETAILS:

To keep track of the nodes that I've already visited I use a hash set so that I can add, remove, and find elements in constant time. 
To keep track of the path from start to destination, I use a hash map which has a link to each node from which it was discovered. 

USER SEARCH OPTIONS: The user can pick from 3 searching algoirthims to build the shortest path.

Depth first search - (This can also be implemented recursively)
To keep track of where to search, I implement a stack to find the last node I tried to explore from 
until finding another path. 

Breadth first search - (The breadth search path produces a shorter path than depth first search)
To keep track of where to search, I implement a queue and look at the first item in 
the queue and explore out from the neighbours and mark that node as visited. 


Dijkstra's algorithm -
